# TSPLR

**TS _(this)_ PLR _(player)_** is a hobby project with one goal: produce a MP3 player.  
Our goal can be split into two parts: *efficiency* and *functionality*.

#### Efficiency
- Whatever code written needs to be fast.
- Large audio files need to be handled effortlessly.
- Battery life needs to substancial.
- Output (code size) needs to be small so not a lot of storage is taken up.  

#### Functionality
- Must do basic functionality and nothing more.
- Basics like play/pause, skip, rewind, controlling progress bar.
- Have *basic* UI to choose songs and playlists.
- Minimal amount of physical buttons.
- Rotary encoder provides majority of scrolling and click functionality.
- Things like creating playlists or adding songs need to be done externally using a desktop app.

## Repository Content

This repository will contain the code for the following:
- [ ] An 'app' which acts as the UI for the MP3 player. This provides all of the play/pause functionality the user will interact with while using the physical device.
- [ ] A build of the operation system that the MP3 player will run. The current plan is the installer automatically installs everything the user will need onto the physical MP3 player (like the aformentioned 'app') so that it is usable right after setup.
- [ ] The desktop app to allow users to download songs and create playlists.

As more is added, the repository will be updated with build instructions and locations of everything.
